# Decentralized Auto Trading Platform
## Introduction
This project is an automated trading execution system based on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can deploy their own trading execution contracts and submit trading rules and execution conditions. When the conditions are met, the system will automatically execute the trade, eliminating the need for users to constantly monitor their devices or rely on centralized exchanges. Users have full control and can open their own decentralized automated trading system, equivalent to having their own automated investment trading engine, trust fund, and decentralized will execution program.

In addition, this system is an open automated trading system, and users can develop more efficient, convenient, and secure usage scenarios.

## Usage Process
1. Deploy your own automated trading contract on the platform. Only the contract creator can perform subsequent management operations on the contract.
2. Transfer funds from your wallet to the contract.
3. Create automated trading tasks and set trigger conditions. Conditions can be set based on time, block height, or interaction data with other contracts.
4. When the conditions are met, external miners interact with your contract as a trigger to execute specific trading tasks.

## Implementation
The automated trading smart contract of this system will become a standard ERC on Ethereum. Miners can obtain all information about automated trading contracts and their automated trading tasks through the program interface provided by the platform or by scanning the contract interface on Ethereum. When the conditions of automated trading tasks are met, miners submit requests to trigger the execution of the transaction through competition. The contract will execute the first transaction request received and reward the miner who submitted the transaction.

## Fees
The platform does not charge any fees for users to deploy automated trading contracts on Ethereum or manage automated trading tasks in the contract. Users only need to pay gas fees (or the platform can consider paying gas fees). Each time an automated trading transaction is executed, the platform will charge a portion of the transaction fee, which will be used to reward community participants, including users, miners, and developers. Transaction fees support ETH and stablecoins, and the price of fees depends on the type of transaction.

## Token Model
Our decentralized automated trading platform will use two types of tokens: wrap tokens and governance tokens. Wrap tokens are used to facilitate users' understanding of the investment portfolio of their automated trading contracts in their wallets. Governance tokens are used to pay transaction fees, community governance, and project direction voting governance.

### Wrap Tokens
Wrap tokens are ERC-20 tokens, with each Wrap token representing a specific asset type. When users deploy a contract, a Wrap token is automatically created to record the user's equity in their investment portfolio in the automated trading contract. Users can view the total value of all their Wrap tokens in their wallets and understand the composition of their investment portfolios. The value of Wrap tokens will change with changes in the investment portfolio in the automated trading contract.

### Governance Tokens
Governance tokens are fungible tokens used to pay transaction fees, community governance, and project direction voting governance. Users will receive a certain number of governance tokens when deploying automated trading contracts and managing automated trading. In addition, the top three miners who interact with the contract to trigger the execution of the transaction each time will also receive governance tokens.

#### Governance
We will manage the distribution rules and quantities of governance tokens and the allocation of transaction fees through community voting. Every holder of governance tokens has voting rights and can participate in decision-making on project direction, such as modifying the token model or adding new features. In community voting, each holder of governance tokens has one vote, and community members can make decisions based on the majority principle. We will provide a decentralized voting platform for the community to ensure the fairness and transparency of the voting process.
