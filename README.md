## Abstract

In this paper, we'll introduce Jarvis, the decentralized solution to handle your assets on the blockchain automatically. You first need to deposit your assets into Jarvis's smart contract. Then you can set up plans to do with these assets. It could be an automatic investment plan. It could be a programmatic interaction with other contracts. It could be a streamlined investment on other projects. Or it could be a testament. When the prerequisites of the plans are fulfilled, Jarvis will execute the plans for you without your further interaction using your wallet or private key until you cancel the plan, the plan is finished, or the assets of the plan are insufficient to execute.

With Jarvis, you can safely put all your programmatic executions on the blockchain. You don't have to worry about the outage of your local laptop where you run your crontab tasks to do your programmatic operations. You won't be concerned with the integrity of the CEXs where you set up automatic investment plans. You don't risk that you don't mention the private keys or secret recovery phrase in the testament so that your crypto assets are truly lost forever.

## Introduction

Jarvis is a smart contract framework on EVM networks, enabling you to move assets on-chain following predefined rules. Also Jarvis is a crypto trading platform that provide a tool that enables people who know about crypto, and those who do not, to make money off each other in a way that is fair and mutually beneficial.


But we can't truly automatically or programmatically interact with the blockchain using our wallet like MetaMask or private keys. You may say you can write a crontab job running on your laptop or a cloud instance. But the instance on which your crontab job is running may be shut down unexpectedly. You may say you can leverage the CEXs to do some automatic jobs like an automatic investment. But after everything that happened on FTX, I guess it's not the best choice.

Since we've come to the crypto world, why don't we choose a decentralized way? We are building a decentralized agent for you. I will help you do programmatic work for you. It can:
- hold all your assets and you can withdraw your assets whenever you want
- interact with other kinds of smart contracts as you instructed to manage your portfolio
- do the automatic investment for you periodically
- manage your will to make sure your assets will be distributed as you want
- do all kinds of other operations you can do with your wallets

## Decentralized wallet

So we propose to build a decentralized wallet to hold users' assets. The wallet client would just be the wallet reviewer or private key keeper. 

### Deposit Assets

#### Deposit and Withdraw Tokens

We support the native token and all kinds of ERC-20 tokens in Jarvis. For each kind of token, we'll have a separate ERC-20 smart contract

#### Deposit NFTs

### Set up Programmatic Plans

### Withdraw Assets
