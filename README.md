## Abstract

In this paper, we'll introduce a decentralized wallet to help you control your assets. The decentralized wallet is implemented by a smart contract on the blockchain. When people pass away some day, they won't have a risk that any else doesn't know the private keys to their wallets so that their assets can't be given to their families, or friends. 

The decentralzied wallet can hold all kinds of assets, not only the native tokens, but also ERO-20 tokens and NFTs. At the meantime, it can help you interact with other Defi protocals as well.

## Introduction

The context of the  crpto, blockchain, ETH bla bla bla

But there is a critical risk that when someone is gone, this guy may don't have a chance to tranfer all his assets to his families or friends, or he don't have a chance to give the private keys or secret recovery phrases. As the blockchain is decentralized, no one else could help your families or friends recovery the wallet private key or get back the money. We're here to solve this problem.

## Decentralized wallet

So we propose to build a decentralized wallet to hold users accessts. The wallet client would just be the wallet reviewer or private key keeper.
